Distributed Layer
=================


The distributed ledger layer provides decentralized database
functionality to Eden and is used on the basis of the Linux
Foundation's open source project, Hyperledger. The DLL
stores all data generated by Eden in a block. The data
cannot be modified and can be only added. The DLL stores the
data on a disk device and assumes that all of the stored
data originated from a legitimate transaction.

The DLL can find the necessary data from the outside by
using a block ID or a transaction ID, and also provides a
function of accessing information about all transactions
included in the block. The DLL has a BlockCache module to
minimize disk access.

BlockCache mainly stores currently used blocks in memory,
and when a requested block cannot be found, it reads the
block from a disk and loads it into the memory. Depending on
frequency of use, it is possible to determine blocks that
should be kept in the memory and those that should not, and
thus a cache effect with optimal use of memory can be
obtained.
