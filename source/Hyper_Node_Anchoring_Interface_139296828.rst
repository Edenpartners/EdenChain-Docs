            .. rubric:: Overview
               :name: HyperNodeAnchoringInterface-Overview

            The purpose of this article is to outline steps to define an
            interface when anchoring an asset.

            The asset is anchored by storing pertinent information in
            the metadata of a given asset.

            A successfully anchored asset will disclose its
            characteristic.

            .. rubric:: Interface Definition
               :name: HyperNodeAnchoringInterface-InterfaceDefinition

            -  Anchor Asset Definition

            ::

               {
                   "data": {
                      "type": "anchor",
                       "kind": "supernode",
                       "category": "tedn"
                   }
               }

            -  Anchor Transaction Definition

            When you create an anchor, the following is added to the
            metadata of the given transaction. Each transaction
            automatically has an asset.

            ::

               {
                   'type': 'anchor'
                   "anchor":{
                       "timestamp":  timestamp,
                       "hex": <anchor 64 bytes>,
                       "last_tx_id":  <64 byte tx hash value>
                   }
               }

            | 

            .. rubric:: Token Transfer
               :name: HyperNodeAnchoringInterface-TokenTransfer

            It takes 1 token to anchor. 1 token is created when you make
            your first transfer from EDN Token Asset.

            For now, we create a new asset for each anchor.

            We follow this protocol to avoid mixing of tokens, however,
            the method is open to change if needed.

            When each anchor is created, you need to satisfy the
            following. First, you must transfer 1 token; second, you
            should have the next unspent anchor information.

            .. rubric:: Anchor Server Role
               :name: HyperNodeAnchoringInterface-AnchorServerRole

            You read TX at every set time. Hash the information and save
            it in the HyperNode.

            Therefore, the anchor server must be able to access both
            HyperNode and SuperNode by default.

            | 

            Anchor Asset is created from outside. Afterward, anchor work
            is done in accordance to Asset ID.

            Currently, AS can only do TEDN. Additional API set for
            anchor will be defined in the future.
