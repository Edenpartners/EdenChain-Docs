            | The Edenchain SDK is a library that allows blockchain
              developers to use Edenchain easily.
            | It is provided in the form of JavaScript and Python to be
              used in the Client.
            | The EdenChain SDK currently only provides a user-interface
              and provides blockchain account creation and access with
              the necessary interfaces for simple use.

            | 

            This is to explain the environment settings and sample
            programs for the SDK and to provide SDK guide.

            .. rubric:: Structure
               :name: SDK-Structure

            The SDK provides Javascript in npm, and Python in Pip.

            We will support other languages later.

            | 

            The Eden Chain Network will be available in three versions:
            Beta Release, Candidate Release, and General Release.
            Currently, released SDKs provide an interface for Beta
            Release.

            In fact, they both provide the same interface internally,
            but you can easily change the network through the
            initialization settings in the SDK.

            | 

            | 

            | 

            Other network selections will be updated to suit each
            schedule, and the SDK will be deployed with additional
            features for each network.

            | 

            The version to be supported differs for each version of the
            SDK. Therefore, developers should use it with caution.
