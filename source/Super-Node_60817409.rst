            Super Node is a dedicated blockchain network for a specific
            dApp. So you may regard a supernode as a dApp blockchain
            network.

            From an enterprise's viewpoint, the dApp is the business,
            interacting with customers, selling its service. So
            enterprises wants to have full controllability as well as
            governance.

            The concept of a supernode is being introduced to support
            enterprises’ needs. It is independent from a hypernode with
            a separate computing zone. In short, a supernode is a
            complete blockchain running on EdenChain.

            A supernode has its own consensus algorithm and data
            storage.  The image below shows the architecture of a
            supernode.

            Each node stores full data and if there is new transaction
            data, it checks the transaction and performs consensus to
            verify the legitimacy of the transaction. If a majority of
            nodes accept the transaction through the consensus
            mechanism, the data will be written in data storage. In
            general it mimics how blockchains work. The biggest
            difference between a general blockchain and a supernode lies
            in its inherent simplicity.

            One of the crucial values of a super node is its
            performance; a super node should process dApps’ requests
            with a minimum delay in order to give users an experience
            similar to that with which they are accustomed.

            A super node has mandatory modules to fulfill its core
            functions. A Super node is independents from hyper nodes,
            and regardless of a hyper node's availability, it can work
            seamlessly.
