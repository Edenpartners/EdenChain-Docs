            Super Node is a dedicated blockchain network for specific
            dApp. So you may regard super node ad dApp blockchain
            network.

            From enterprise's viewpoint, dApp is business itself,
            interacting with customers, selling its service. So
            enterprise wants to have full controllability as well as
            governance.

            Super node is being introduced to support enterprise's need.
            It is independent from hyper node with separated computing
            zone. In short, super node is a complete blockchain belong
            to Edenchain.

            So super node has its own consensus algorithm and data
            storage.  The below image shows architecture of super node.

            Each node has full data and if there is a new transaction
            data, it checks transaction and does consensus to verify
            legitimacy of the transaction. If majority nodes accept the
            transaction through consensus mechanism, the data will be
            written in data storage. It sounds like how general
            blockchain works. The most big difference between general
            blockchain and super node is placed in simplicity.

            What it does means that one of the critical value of super
            node comes from performance, super node is supposed to
            process dApp's request with minimum delay to give similliar
            user experience like common app.

            So super node has mandatory modules to fulfill its core
            functions. Super node is independents from hyper nodes,
            regardless of hyper node's availability, it can work
            seamlessly.
