            Define urlscheme to work with the app on the web server. Be
            sure to leave the urlscheme for the installation as it is.
            The withdraw or deposit should be processed as a universal
            link, so that if there is no app, the installation screen is
            displayed through the browser.

            userid_hash changes the user id to a hex string after sha256
            () and sends only the first 32 digits.

            Here is an example of what python does.

            | 

            ::

               import hashlib 
               hashlib.sha256('id@id.com'.encode()).hexdigest()[:32]

            | 

            Here, the logged-in ID on the web and the APP ID may not be
            matched. In this case, the app compares the id and displays
            an alarming message to log in with a different account.

            If id does not exist, it is displayed without checking.
            (Example: edenwallet://?action=withdraw)

            -  Android

               -  Connect to
                  Play:  \ ``market://details?id=``\ io.edenchain.ewallet
               -  Withdraw:
                  https://ewallet.edenchain.io/withdraw/?id=userid_hash
               -  Deposit:
                  https://ewallet.edenchain.io/deposit/?id=userid_hash

            -  iOS

               -  Connect to AppStore:
                  itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/id1234567890 (Upload
                  to the app store and update when app id is
                  determined.)
               -  Withdraw:
                  https://ewallet.edenchain.io/withdraw/\ ?id=userid_hash
               -  Deposit:
                  https://ewallet.edenchain.io/deposit/?id=userid_hash

            | 

            In the E-garden, play and app store connections remain the
            same on the initial installation screen.

            Thereafter, the withdraw and deposit changes as defined
            above.

            | 

            DApp modifies the url in the call to withdraw and deposit as
            above.

            | 

            In case of E-Wallet App, it is modified to process only each
            withdraws or deposits.
