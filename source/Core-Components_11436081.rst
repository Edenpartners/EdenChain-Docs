            EdenChain is composed of several core components and to have
            a clear understanding of EdenChain it is useful to browse
            them in turn.

            The below image depicts core components, their relationships
            and how they are deployed.

            EdenChainis a cloud based blockchain platform,andas you can
            seethere isheavy usage of kubernates. Hypernodes, super node
            and the eden core areallrunning on top of kubernates.

            Eden core moduleshandle theessential business logic required
            to operateEdenChain,whereaspure blockchain related functions
            are located in hyper nodes and super nodes.

            A Hyper node manages EDN coin, TEDN coin and anchoring. It
            is the main blockchain inEdenChain.

            A Super node is solely dedicated to processingrequests from
            corresponding dApps.dAppsareis not allowed to accessahyper
            node directly,theyaccesse a super node to processtheirtasks.
            Then depending on requests, core componentscome into play.

            AdApp serveranddApp client are supposed to be created
            bythedApp provider.ThedApp server connectsto asuper node to
            handle corresponding tasks submitted fromthedApp client.

            .. rubric:: Hyper Node
               :name: CoreComponents-HyperNode

            Hyper node has 3 major tasks. 

            -  Native Coin, EDN Management
            -  TEDN Anchoring
            -  Super Node Transaction Data Anchoring

            .. rubric:: Super Node
               :name: CoreComponents-SuperNode

            Super node handlesdApps’ requests, more precisely it stores
            TEDN related transactions generated bydApps.

            Itsprimary task\ s\ is to recordand storeTEDN transactions.

            -  To record TEDN related transactions 

            .. rubric:: Coin Server
               :name: CoreComponents-CoinServer

            EdenChainhas internallytwotypes of coin, EDN(native coin),
            TEDN(internal coin foradApp). TEDN is the main coin required
            to useadApp. 

            TheCoin server exchanges EDN to TEDN, TEDN to EDN, it acts
            like an internal exchange server inEdenChain. 

            -  Convert EDN to TEDN
            -  Convert TEDN to EDN

            .. rubric:: Balance Server
               :name: CoreComponents-BalanceServer

            TheBalance server processes actual coin related transactions
            such as deposit/withdraw but it is dedicated for TEDN.

            It has a sophisticated logicin orderto manage TEDN correctly
            to secure transactions betweenadApp client and dApp
            serverand to avoidunexpected situations such as hacking,
            double spending, system error and so on.Basically,the
            balance of TEDN should not be manipulated and there should
            be no errors.

            -  To handle deposit/withdraw TEDN

            .. rubric:: Transaction Server
               :name: CoreComponents-TransactionServer

            The Transaction Server is the middleware of all super-node
            transactions.

            Whenatransaction is transmitted, the Transaction server will
            validate the transaction and write it toasuper node.

            After thesuper node completesablock commit,thetransaction
            server will be notifiedofthe completed events,retrievethe
            blockwhichwas completed and write it to data storage.

            If a request to read transaction blocks is submitted, the
            Transaction Server will retrieve it from data storage
            similar to a cache read.

            The Transaction server does block height/transaction
            anchoring.

            -  TEDN Transaction Cache
            -  To write transactions in super node
            -  To read transaction from cache
            -  To write anchoring data into hyper node

            .. rubric:: EIAM
               :name: CoreComponents-EIAM

            EIAM is an identity server
            intheEdenChainplatform.Itplaysanimportant role because it
            provides identity information toarequester.

            EIAM has account info, user specific information and so on
            inanencrypted manner to secure data. 

            For higher security, EIAM supportstwotypes of user,anormal
            user andaserver user.A normaluser has limited
            accessibilityrestricted tothe connected user's data only. 

            TheServer user has full accessibility,and is createdand
            granted byEdenChain's admin.TheServer user uses TLS.

            -  Identity Management
            -  To send identity information to requester
            -  To sign TEDN transaction
            -  To create TEDN wallet address

            .. rubric:: dApp Server
               :name: CoreComponents-dAppServer

            ThedApp server handles requests fromadApp client with its
            own business logic.

            From adevelopment viewpoint,thedApp server hastwomajor
            roles, 1) business logic, 2) access toasuper node.

            For security reasons, thedApp client is not supposed to
            accessasuper node directly. We expects HTML5 will be a major
            technology for dApp building. HTML5 isaneasy to use, cross
            platform with goodaeco system, but isrelatively easy to hack
            and there are many hacking tools available. So blockchain
            related processing isrelegated to thedApp server's
            functionality. 

            -  To manage TEDN
            -  Business logics
            -  TEDN balance check
            -  Sign in/Sign out
